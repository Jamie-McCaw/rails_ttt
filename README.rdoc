This is my first attempt at a Ruby on Rails Multiplayer game, the game is hosted on heroku and playable by going to: http://rail-tic-tac-toe.herokuapp.com/twoplayer

This works by sending your opponent a link created after taking your first move.

You can also play the single player vs. AI unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe at: http://rail-tic-tac-toe.herokuapp.com/
